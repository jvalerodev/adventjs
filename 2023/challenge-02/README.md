# Challenge #2: 🏭 We start the factory

In Santa's workshop, the elves have a **gift list** they wish to make and a limited set of materials.

Gifts are strings of text and materials are characters. Your task is to write a function that, given a list of gifts and the available materials, returns a **list of the gifts that can be made**.

A gift can be made if we have all the necessary materials to make it.

### Examples:

```javascript
const gifts = ["tren", "oso", "pelota"];
const materials = "tronesa";

manufacture(gifts, materials); // ["tren", "oso"]
// 'tren' YES because its letters are in 'tronesa'
// 'oso' YES because its letters are in 'tronesa'
// 'pelota' NO because its letters are NOT in 'tronas'

const gifts = ["juego", "puzzle"];
const materials = "jlepuz";

manufacture(gifts, materials); // ["puzzle"]

const gifts = ["libro", "ps5"];
const materials = "psli";

manufacture(gifts, materials); // []
```
